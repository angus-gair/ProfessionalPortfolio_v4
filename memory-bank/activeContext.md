# Active Context - Professional Portfolio v4

## Current Work Focus
The application is currently focused on optimization and consolidation of the analytics tracking implementation. Key focus areas include:

1. Consolidating duplicate Google Tag Manager scripts for improved performance
2. Setting up the Memory Bank documentation system
3. Creating a comprehensive system diagram
4. Ensuring all features work correctly across the website
5. Archiving redundant files to maintain clean project structure

## Recent Changes
- Created consolidated GTM script (`gtm-consolidated.js`) combining functionality from:
  - `datalayer-init.js`
  - `gtm-config.js`
  - `ga4-config.js`
- Updated base.html template to reference the consolidated script
- Archived redundant GTM script files to static/archive/js/
- Set up Memory Bank documentation according to cursor-memory-bank-rules.md
- Created comprehensive documentation for project architecture and functionality

## Next Steps
1. Test the consolidated GTM script to ensure all analytics tracking works correctly
2. Continue improving the documentation in the Memory Bank
3. Consider implementing additional features:
   - Cookie consent management for GDPR compliance
   - Improved caching for API responses
   - Lazy loading for images and embedded content
   - Contact form submission handler
   - Dynamic copyright year in footer

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Analytics Optimization**: We've decided to consolidate GTM scripts to reduce HTTP requests and improve page load performance while maintaining all tracking functionality.
2. **Documentation Approach**: Using Memory Bank pattern for documentation to ensure continuity across development sessions and improve project maintainability.
3. **Script Organization**: Moving redundant scripts to an archive folder instead of deleting them completely, preserving project history while cleaning up the active codebase.
4. **Code Structure Decisions**: Maintaining separation between server-side and client-side functionality while ensuring they work together seamlessly.
5. **Feature Implementation Priority**: Focusing on foundational optimizations before adding new features to ensure the core application is solid.
