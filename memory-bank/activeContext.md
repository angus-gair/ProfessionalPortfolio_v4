# Active Context - Professional Portfolio v4

## Current Work Focus
The application has been successfully migrated from Replit to a local Ubuntu 24.04 WSL environment. The current focus is now on:
1. Testing all features to ensure they work correctly
2. Making the application accessible via URL
3. Fine-tuning the environment if necessary
4. Adding new routes as requested

## Recent Changes
- Set up Python virtual environment
- Installed all required dependencies
- Created .env file for environment variables
- Updated app.py to load environment variables from .env
- Created run.sh script for easy application startup
- Copied historical project files to the correct locations
- Started the application locally
- Added new route '/optimisation' to serve the Christmas budget optimisation HTML file

## Next Steps
1. Test all application features (GitHub integration, Tableau embedding, etc.)
2. Configure network access to make the application accessible via URL
3. Add any missing static files or fix path issues
4. Document any remaining issues or challenges

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **API Integration Testing**: Verify that GitHub and Tableau integrations work correctly
2. **URL Access**: Determine the best approach for making the application accessible via URL (port forwarding, hostname configuration, etc.)
3. **Environment Variables**: Consider if additional environment variables need to be set
4. **Performance**: Monitor application performance in the new environment
5. **Direct File Serving**: Serving HTML files directly rather than through templates for certain routes
