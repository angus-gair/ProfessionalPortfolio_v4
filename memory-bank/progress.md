## What's Left to Build

## Current Status
The Professional Portfolio v4 is functionally complete with all core features implemented. The recent focus has been on optimizing the analytics tracking implementation by consolidating duplicate GTM scripts and setting up comprehensive documentation through the Memory Bank system.

The application is running successfully in the local development environment on Ubuntu 24.04 WSL and is ready for further enhancements and optimizations.

## Known Issues
1. **API Rate Limiting**: GitHub API can reach rate limits with frequent refreshes when not authenticated
2. **Analytics Blocking**: Some analytics tracking may be blocked by ad blockers
3. **Contact Form**: Form submissions currently lack server-side processing
4. **Historical Project Paths**: Some historical project file paths may need adjustment
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Some content could be further optimized for very small screens
6. **Performance**: API calls could be cached to improve performance on repeat visits
