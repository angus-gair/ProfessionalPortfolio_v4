# Progress - Professional Portfolio v4

## What Works
- Memory Bank system implemented with all required files
- Python dependencies installed
- Environment variables configured
- Application code updated to load environment variables from .env file
- Project files organized for local environment
- Application can be started with run.sh script
- Custom '/optimisation' route to serve the Christmas budget optimisation HTML file
- Collapsible code/output sections in the optimisation page

## What's Left to Build
1. **Validation**:
   - Test all features in local environment
   - Verify API integrations work correctly
   - Ensure responsive design functions properly
   - Test the new optimisation route with collapsible sections

2. **Documentation**:
   - Possibly enhance Memory Bank documentation based on testing results

## Current Status
- Application transferred from Replit to local WSL environment
- Flask application running locally
- All necessary dependencies installed
- Memory Bank documentation completed
- Environment variables configured
- Historical project files copied to appropriate locations
- New route added for serving the optimisation HTML file directly
- Added collapsible functionality to code and output sections

## Known Issues
- The application is currently only accessible locally
- GITHUB_API_TOKEN not set, which might lead to GitHub API rate limiting
- Need to verify all features working correctly (GitHub integration, Tableau embedding, etc.)
