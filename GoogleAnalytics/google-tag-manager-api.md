Got it. I’ll look into how you can manage Google Tag Manager programmatically — including creating tags, triggers, variables, and publishing containers — all without using the web interface. I’ll also check if there’s a CLI, SDK, or API that supports this kind of configuration automation.

I’ll report back with the best tools and resources to get you started.

# Automating Google Tag Manager Configuration (GTM as Code)

Managing Google Tag Manager configurations programmatically is possible using the **Google Tag Manager API** and client libraries. This allows you to script the creation of tags, triggers, variables, and even publish containers – enabling GTM changes to be managed in code or CI/CD pipelines rather than the web interface. Below we outline how to perform common GTM configuration tasks via API/CLI, with examples and considerations for automation.

## Using the Google Tag Manager API for Configuration

Google provides a RESTful **Tag Manager API** that exposes endpoints for all major GTM entities (accounts, containers, workspaces, tags, triggers, variables, etc.). With this API, you can create and update tags/triggers, manage workspaces and versions, and publish containers programmatically ([Is there any way to automate the process of creating tags and triggers in google tag manager? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74445693/is-there-any-way-to-automate-the-process-of-creating-tags-and-triggers-in-google#:~:text=0)) ([Google Tag Manager API Integrations - Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/apps/google-tag-manager#:~:text=The%20Google%20Tag%20Manager%20API,versions%20of%20your%20tag%20configurations)). Key capabilities include:

- **Creating Tags** – You can create GTM tags (e.g. GA4 events, GA4 configuration tags, Google Ads pixels, etc.) by calling the API with a tag definition. For example, a GA4 **Event** tag is represented with `"type": "gaawe"` (Google Analytics 4 Event) and parameters for the event name and parameters. In an exported GTM JSON, a GA4 event tag might look like:  

  ```json
  {
    "name": "My Custom Event",
    "type": "gaawe",
    "parameter": [
      { "type": "TEMPLATE", "key": "eventName", "value": "my_event" },
      { "type": "LIST", "key": "eventParameters", "list": [ 
          { "type": "MAP", "map": [
              { "type": "TEMPLATE", "key": "name", "value": "param1" },
              { "type": "TEMPLATE", "key": "value", "value": "value1" }
          ]}
      ]},
      { "type": "TAG_REFERENCE", "key": "measurementId", "value": "GA4_G-XXXXXXXX" }
    ],
    "firingTriggerId": ["YOUR_TRIGGER_ID"]
  }
  ```  

  In this example, `type: "gaawe"` denotes a GA4 Event tag, `eventName` is the custom event name, `eventParameters` can include a list of key–value pairs, and `measurementId` is set via a **TAG_REFERENCE** to an existing GA4 config tag (with Measurement ID) ([Creating GA4 tag using Google Tag Manager REST APIs - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75902023/creating-ga4-tag-using-google-tag-manager-rest-apis#:~:text=%7B%20,eventName)) ([Creating GA4 tag using Google Tag Manager REST APIs - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75902023/creating-ga4-tag-using-google-tag-manager-rest-apis#:~:text=Looks%20like%20you%20missing%20this,part)). In practice, you would first create a GA4 Configuration tag (`"type": "gaawc"`) that sets the Measurement ID, then reference it in GA4 event tags. (The GTM API documentation doesn’t explicitly list all tag types like GA4, so a common approach is to create a tag in the UI, export it to JSON, and use that as a model for your API calls ([Creating GA4 tag using Google Tag Manager REST APIs - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75902023/creating-ga4-tag-using-google-tag-manager-rest-apis#:~:text=It%27s%20a%20common%20misunderstanding%20in,GTM%20REST%20API)).)

- **Defining Triggers** – Triggers can be created via the API by specifying a trigger *type* (event type) and any conditions or settings. The API supports all the native trigger types such as page views, clicks, form submissions, scroll depth, element visibility, timers, history changes, etc. For example, to create an “All Pages” pageview trigger, you can POST a trigger with `{"name": "All Pages Trigger", "type": "PAGEVIEW"}` to the workspace’s triggers endpoint ([Google Tag Manager API - Developer's Guide  |  Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/api/v2/devguide#:~:text=hello_world_trigger%20%3D%20,World%20Rule%27%2C%20%27type%27%3A%20%27PAGEVIEW%27)). For more complex triggers like scroll depth or clicks, you set the `type` to the appropriate event (e.g. `"scrollDepth"` for a Scroll Depth trigger, `"click"` or `"linkClick"` for click triggers, `"formSubmission"` for form submits) ([REST Resource: accounts.containers.workspaces.triggers  |  Tag Platform  |  Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/api/reference/rest/v2/accounts.containers.workspaces.triggers#:~:text=,ampScroll)) ([REST Resource: accounts.containers.workspaces.triggers  |  Tag Platform  |  Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/api/reference/rest/v2/accounts.containers.workspaces.triggers#:~:text=)), and include additional parameters/conditions. A Scroll Depth trigger, for instance, would use `type: "scrollDepth"` and provide thresholds via parameters such as `verticalScrollPercentageList` (e.g. 50, 75, 100) to define when it fires. Similarly, element visibility triggers (`"elementVisibility"`) accept a CSS selector and visibility thresholds as parameters. All these fields are available in the API’s trigger resource schema.

- **Enabling & Creating Variables** – The API also lets you manage **variables**. Built-in variables (like Click URL, Scroll Depth Thresholds, Form ID, etc. that you normally enable via checkboxes in the UI) can be activated by calling the **built_in_variables.create** method for the workspace. You specify which built-in variable types to enable (e.g. `"clickElement"`, `"clickText"`, `"scrollDepthThreshold"`, etc.), and GTM will make them available in the container ([Google Tag Manager API - Developer's Guide  |  Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/api/v2/devguide#:~:text=)). If a built-in variable is not activated, it won’t be usable in triggers or tags ([Variable Guide For Google Tag Manager | Simo Ahava's blog](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/variable-guide-google-tag-manager/#:~:text=Variable%20Guide%20For%20Google%20Tag,it%27s%20not%20activated%2C%20it%20can%27t)), so your automation script should enable any needed built-ins before using them. You can also create **user-defined variables** (e.g. a Data Layer Variable or Constant) via the API by specifying the variable type and settings in a similar way to tags/triggers (using the variables endpoint). For instance, a Data Layer variable can be created with a body like `{"name": "MyVar", "type": "DATA_LAYER", "parameter": [ { "key": "dataLayerVariableKey", "value": "someKey" } ] }`. Once created, these variable IDs/names can be referenced in your tag or trigger definitions.

## Previewing and Publishing via API

One of the challenges in GTM automation is verifying changes and pushing them live. Google Tag Manager’s API provides mechanisms for both **previewing** changes and **publishing** container versions:

- **Preview (Debug)** – You can initiate a container preview **programmatically** using the **workspaces.quick_preview** endpoint. This call will generate a **fake container version** from the current workspace changes for preview purposes ([Tag Manager API  |  Tag Platform  |  Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/api/reference/rest#:~:text=%60quick_preview%60%20%60POST%20%2Ftagmanager%2Fv2%2F,path%7D%3Aresolve_conflict)). In practice, after calling quick_preview, you receive a **preview container ID or link** which can be opened in the Tag Manager preview/debug mode to verify that your tags fire as expected. (Under the hood, this is essentially what the GTM UI does when you click “Preview”). While the API can create the preview version, you would still use a browser to inspect the debug console – the API itself doesn’t expose the debug UI. Still, automating the preview step is useful in a CI pipeline (you could output the preview URL for testers or automated tests). GTM also supports **Environments** (e.g. dev, staging) that you can manage via API; you could deploy a workspace to a *staging environment* and use that for testing on a test site, for example ([continuous integration - GTM control on CI/CD - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77017405/gtm-control-on-ci-cd#:~:text=In%20some%20rare%20cases%2C%20it%27s,again%2C%20not%20requiring%20CI%2FCD%20involvement)).

- **Publishing Containers** – After creating or updating tags in a workspace, the API allows you to **publish** those changes to your live container. The typical workflow is: first call **workspaces.create_version** to create a Container Version from your workspace, then call **containers.versions.publish** on that version. This will push the new version live (just like hitting *Submit* > *Publish* in the UI). The Tag Manager API endpoints exist for listing, creating, and publishing container versions ([Google Tag Manager API - Developer's Guide  |  Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/api/v2/devguide#:~:text=,57)) ([Google Tag Manager API - Developer's Guide  |  Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/api/v2/devguide#:~:text=,67)). You’ll need the appropriate OAuth scope (`tagmanager.publish`) to do this. In a CI/CD scenario, you might automate this by having your deployment script create a new version once changes are merged, then publish it to production. Do note that **publishing via API will instantly affect the live site** (unless you publish to a specific Environment), so ensure proper testing/approvals in your pipeline.

## CLI and SDK Tools for GTM Automation

**Client Libraries:** Google offers client libraries for many languages (JavaScript/Node.js, Python, Java, etc.) to interact with the Tag Manager API ([Google Tag Manager API - Developer's Guide  |  Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/api/v2/devguide#:~:text=Select%20the%20programming%20language%20you,intend%20follow%20examples%20in)) ([Google Tag Manager API - Developer's Guide  |  Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/api/v2/devguide#:~:text=account%2C%20locate%20or%20create%20containers%2C,to%20familiarize%20yourself%20with%20Google)). These SDKs handle the HTTP calls and authorization for you. For example, using the Node.js client (`googleapis` package), you can script tag creation. A Node snippet to create a tag might look like: 

```js
const {google} = require('googleapis');
const tagmanager = google.tagmanager('v2');
// ...authorize client...
await tagmanager.accounts.containers.workspaces.tags.create({
  parent: workspacePath,
  requestBody: {
    name: "My GA4 Event",
    type: "gaawe",
    parameter: [ /* ... */ ],
    firingTriggerId: [triggerId]
  }
});
```

Likewise, you can call `...workspaces.triggers.create(...)` to add triggers, etc. The official **GTM API Developer Guide** (v2) provides detailed examples in Python and JS for creating a workspace, adding a tag, creating a trigger, and linking them ([Google Tag Manager API - Developer's Guide  |  Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/api/v2/devguide#:~:text=,create%20a%20page%20view%20trigger)) ([Google Tag Manager API - Developer's Guide  |  Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/api/v2/devguide#:~:text=5,fire%20on%20the%20trigger)). Using these libraries in a CI/CD pipeline (for instance, a Python script in Jenkins or a Node script in a GitHub Action) allows you to treat GTM configurations as code.

**Command Line (gcloud and others):** There isn’t a dedicated `gcloud` command group for Tag Manager, since GTM is part of Google Marketing Platform (not a Google Cloud resource). However, you can still call the GTM REST API from the command line using tools like **curl** or **Google’s APIs Explorer**. For example, you could use `gcloud auth print-access-token` and then `curl` the Tag Manager API endpoints with that token. In practice, most teams use a small script or an existing library rather than raw curl for anything complex. Third-party automation tools and services can also help – for instance, **Pipedream** and similar workflow automation platforms integrate with GTM’s API to let you run scripts that sync tags or environments as part of a pipeline ([Google Tag Manager API Integrations - Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/apps/google-tag-manager#:~:text=The%20Google%20Tag%20Manager%20API,versions%20of%20your%20tag%20configurations)). There are even community SDKs/wrappers (e.g. an R package **googleTagManageR**, or Terraform community modules) that aim to simplify GTM API usage, though these may not cover 100% of GTM features.

**Note on Permissions:** Any API approach will require proper authentication. Typically, you’d use an OAuth client (or service account with domain-wide delegation) that has access to your GTM account. Ensure the account has the needed permissions (at least *Read/Write* on the container for creating assets, and *Publish* rights for pushing live) and use the appropriate API scopes (e.g. `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tagmanager.edit.containers` for editing and `.../tagmanager.publish` for publishing ([Google Tag Manager API - Developer's Guide  |  Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/api/v2/devguide#:~:text=%27https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Ftagmanager.publish%27%20))).

## Limitations and Tips for GTM Configuration as Code

While automating GTM is powerful, there are a few **limitations and considerations** to keep in mind:

- **No Bulk Container Import via API:** Google Tag Manager’s API does **not** provide a single endpoint to import a whole container configuration (as you might upload a JSON file in the UI). You must create each tag, trigger, and variable via separate calls. This means you are responsible for managing dependencies between them (e.g., creating variables first so triggers can reference them, capturing the IDs of created triggers to attach to tags, etc.) ([continuous integration - GTM control on CI/CD - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77017405/gtm-control-on-ci-cd#:~:text=The%20easiest%20way%20would%20be,tags%2C%20triggers%20and%20variables%20yourself)). There is an endpoint to retrieve a container **version** as JSON ([continuous integration - GTM control on CI/CD - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77017405/gtm-control-on-ci-cd#:~:text=Use%20this%20to%20get%20a,version)), but no corresponding official endpoint to import that JSON back. (Some developers have resorted to workarounds like using headless browsers or internal APIs to simulate the “Import Container” UI, but that’s not officially supported ([continuous integration - GTM control on CI/CD - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77017405/gtm-control-on-ci-cd#:~:text=An%20update%3A%20I%20looked%20into,Google%20is%20far%20from%20perfect)).) In short, automation is doable, but you’ll be writing scripts to assemble your container piece by piece.

- **Understanding Tag/Trigger Types:** Not all configuration details are well-documented in the API reference. Basic tag and trigger creation is documented, but specifics for newer tag types (GA4, etc.) or certain complex trigger conditions might require referencing export JSON or community examples ([Creating GA4 tag using Google Tag Manager REST APIs - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75902023/creating-ga4-tag-using-google-tag-manager-rest-apis#:~:text=It%27s%20a%20common%20misunderstanding%20in,GTM%20REST%20API)). For instance, the **built-in “All Pages” trigger** isn’t returned by the triggers list API (since it’s implicit), but you can still use it by referencing its ID (commonly `2147479553` for the default All Pages trigger) ([How to use built-in triggers with Google Tag Manager API - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78594476/how-to-use-built-in-triggers-with-google-tag-manager-api#:~:text=But%20if%20you%20want%20to,trigger%20in%20GTM%20API)) or by creating an equivalent pageview trigger yourself. Be prepared to do a bit of trial and error with the API (using Google’s API Explorer or small test scripts) to get the exact fields needed for a given tag or trigger configuration.

- **Preview and Debugging**: As noted, you can initiate previews via API, but the debugging interface is still in the browser. Your automation workflow might output a preview URL for QA to click, or automatically open the preview for a test environment. Also, remember that preview mode requires the container’s preview snippet (or the Tag Assistant browser plugin) to be activated on your site – the API doesn’t bypass that requirement.

- **CI/CD Usage**: Integrating GTM into CI/CD is feasible, but consider if it’s the right approach for your organization. Unlike code deployments, GTM changes are often managed by marketing or analytics teams. Pushing GTM updates on every code release might not be necessary or desired. A common best practice is to use **GTM Environments** (e.g., a "Staging" environment) for testing changes on test sites, and use a single container for both staging and production with environment-specific logic if needed ([continuous integration - GTM control on CI/CD - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77017405/gtm-control-on-ci-cd#:~:text=FYI%2C%20in%20vast%20majority%20of,lowers%20is%20almost%20always%20trivial)). If you do use CI/CD for GTM, treat the GTM container config as code (e.g. keep an exported JSON in version control) and ensure changes are reviewed – the API is powerful and will apply changes immediately without the safety nets of the UI (no confirmation dialogs!).

- **Permission and Quota**: The Tag Manager API has usage quotas and limits ([Google Tag Manager API - Developer's Guide  |  Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/api/v2/devguide#:~:text=Before%20you%20begin)) ([Google Tag Manager API - Developer's Guide  |  Google for Developers](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/api/v2/devguide#:~:text=Caution%3A%20When%20performing%20destructive%20operations,before%20working%20with%20active%20accounts)) (e.g., number of calls per 100 seconds). For normal CI usage this is rarely an issue, but a script creating hundreds of tags at once should be mindful to handle API rate limits. Also, any automated publishing should be done carefully to avoid pushing unapproved changes live.

In summary, **yes – you can fully manage GTM configurations with code**. Using the Google Tag Manager API (via REST calls or client SDKs), developers can create tags (like GA4 event tags), define triggers for user interactions (scroll, clicks, form submissions, etc.), enable necessary variables, and even preview and publish containers without ever opening the GTM web GUI. This enables GTM to be integrated into developer workflows and automated deployments ([Is there any way to automate the process of creating tags and triggers in google tag manager? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74445693/is-there-any-way-to-automate-the-process-of-creating-tags-and-triggers-in-google#:~:text=0)). Just keep in mind the learning curve and limitations: you’ll need to script the relationships between tags/triggers/variables, and the API doesn’t provide a one-shot import of a whole container configuration ([continuous integration - GTM control on CI/CD - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77017405/gtm-control-on-ci-cd#:~:text=An%20update%3A%20I%20looked%20into,Google%20is%20far%20from%20perfect)). With proper tooling and planning, GTM configuration automation can increase consistency and enable version control for your tracking implementations – bringing *analytics tagging* into your Infrastructure as Code practices.
