Technical Approach
The project deliberately uses a minimalist technical approach that maximizes compatibility and reliability:

Static-First Design: Avoiding complex frameworks or build tools to ensure the site works reliably on Replit's platform
Content Focus: Emphasizing high-quality, detailed content over complex interactions
Responsive Design: Using CSS media queries to ensure the site works well on all device sizes
Progressive Enhancement: Starting with a basic, functional experience that works everywhere
Next Steps
The website is essentially complete and ready for sharing. Potential future enhancements could include:

Adding a downloadable resume PDF
Incorporating a blog or articles section for data analysis insights
Adding a simple contact form
Including interactive data visualizations as portfolio examples
The current implementation prioritizes reliability and compatibility while presenting Angus's professional qualifications effectively.
