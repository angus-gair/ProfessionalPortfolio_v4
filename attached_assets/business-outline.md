## Problem Statement

Despite the proliferation of digital services, most small businesses still lack a meaningful online presence, let alone a data-driven approach to operations. In industries like trade services, many operators still rely on phone and paper-based systems, missing opportunities for digital marketing, customer engagement, and operational efficiency. These businesses struggle with:

- No website or outdated web presence
- Manual and error-prone processes (quotes, invoicing, scheduling)
- No centralised CRM or marketing tools
- No access to analytics for decision-making
